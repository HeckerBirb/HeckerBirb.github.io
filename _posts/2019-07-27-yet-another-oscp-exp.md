### #!/bin/bash 
This is not your average golden story. In fact I want to avoid writing yet another OSCP experience post about yet another first attempt victory because there are so many of those already. Instead, this blog post will focus on my take of what is means to "Try Harder" and how I discovered the subtle but important difference between being able to follow ones own methodology, and actually understanding why the methodology ended up as it did.<!-- more --> Just for the record and because this isn't an OSCP experience without it, I will mention that I rooted 4/5 boxes within the first 12 hours, finished my report and got the congratulating email about three weeks later. But that's not really the point of this post.

Without further ado, welcome to the thoughts of a crazy parrot.


### "Work on your methodology", they said...
When going through the course and hacking my way through the lab, I often talked to fellow students and current OSCP certificate holders. One of the questions I frequently asked is what I should focus on learning and how I knew what I needed to know. More often than not, the recommendation was to "work on your methodology". I asked how I would work on it, and what it was exactly, and I got mixed replies. The common denominator however was to hack more machines and learning by doing. I was left feeling a little bit confused, as it felt almost as if I wanted to learn how to swim but had been told that the way to learn how to swim was to try to get across lakes with less and less help. And many lakes, even.

So I swam. I swam for hours and hours every night. In the weekend I swam even more and my goodness was it tough in the beginning. After a while though - a month or so - I started becoming more independent and felt more and more in control. Another month went by and I had written down a lot of notes, useful commands and code snippets. I finally began to feel prepared for the exam, although I knew I still had to practice a few things (more BOFs, writing a report and such). A few days before my 90 days lab time ended I believe I had cracked the code of what it means to "work on your methodology". What it meant to swim. In principle it is actually fairly simple. The hard part is to understand what it is, and how to build it up. Simply put it is a lot of paths to explore, each with their own "path score" indicating the likelihood that going down this particular path will lead somewhere useful.

### Picking the right path
Imagine that ahead of you lie `n` paths that you can explore. Each path represent an action that you can perform, e.g. a tool, script or technique you can use, and each have an imaginary score indicating which path should be explored first. For simplicity, let's suppose the path score is a function `f(x) = L/T` where `L` is the variable likelihood that this action will be helpful, and `T` is the constant time it takes to perform the action. As an example, even if the `www-data` user is typically not likely to have `sudo` privileges, it's a good idea to run `sudo -l` very early on to quickly either rule out that path or get an easy win. 

Now suppose that you have just finished an `nmap` scan of a target machine, and the following interesting ports were discovered: `80` (HTTP), `139` + `445` (SMB) and `3306` (MySQL). Discovering these services automatically rules out a large amount of potential paths to explore, such as anything related to `FTP` or analysing the SSL certificate on an HTTPS website (as neither seem to be present at all). Experience has furthermore told me that MySQL is often never the first path to explore, but likely useful later on.

This is where the methodology comes into play, because "building the methodology" essentially means paving a new path for you to explore, given some circumstance. As you may have guessed, these paths are not linear paths but rather tree-like data structures (like a family tree, starting at you). With experience you start remembering what you can try in different scenarios by heart, and you get a feel for which tests you should perform first, even if they are typically not the way to go. Take a samba share vs. a website as an example: often the way into the machine - especially in a CTF-like environment - is through the website either with or without help from `SMB`. However, since it is relatively easy to explore or rule out a samba share as being a good first step - compared to finding vulnerabilities on a website that is - this is not a bad path to start with. 

As you can imagine, preparation and information gathering are important steps in the process of breaking into a machine or network. Often what appeared to be the optimal path to follow may turn out to be a fluke once more information is discovered and added to the grand equation. Building the methodology is not enough though, because nothing in this world is as black and white as `#000` and `#FFF`. With this in mind, notice how I failed to apply my methodology efficiently, in the first part of my exam, and how I slowly realised what my mistake was and what happened as soon as I applied "Trying Harder" correctly.

### At last, the exam
The very first machine in the exam network that I attempted taught me a valuable lesson about my methodology: trust it, but don't follow it blindly. I decided to use the buffer overflow machine to warm up for the rest of the exam, and I happily followed my well-prepared steps and made progress. Until I didn't. I was confused and wondered if I had done something wrong. Was it stage fright? It wasn't until I sat down and thought about *why* I was performing the steps I performed, that I realised that there was a twist. This wasn't an examination in whether or not I could blindly follow some memorised steps required to successfully perform a buffer overflow, but a test in whether or not I *understood why* I was performing these steps in the first place. Once I did - once I trusted my methodology and didn't follow it blindly - I made all the progress I needed and secured my first handful of points. 

I guess at this point I completely wiped my mind and forgot all about about trusting but not blindly following my methodology, because I did the complete opposite. To my luck however, I soon after successfully compromised the "lesser" machine in the pool. I decided on a next target - the one I knew the most about (i.e. I had the most plausible paths to explore) - and quite quickly figured out what I had to do. I just couldn't do it. Nothing seemed to be working, and even when I found a walkthrough of the vulnerable service that I could follow very closely and step-by-step, I wasn't getting any shells thrown in my general direction. Nothing at all in fact. All I got was more emptiness for my empty feeling.

Thankfully, things were starting to click at this point about 4 hours into the exam. I knew from my methodology that I should try to replicate the steps in the proof of concepts, and that if they didn't work I should try something else. I decided to take a few steps back and tried to gather my thoughts and what I knew about the machine and vulnerability. I tried to compare the "path scores" of the paths I had laid out in front of me, and realised two things. First of all, I was on the right path, I knew that much, but secondly things were not working because as with the other machines there was a twist. Of course there was a twist! Say it with me this time: *Trust your methodology but don't follow it blindly.*

One would think that after three machines which were all compromised in the end because I trusted my methodology and didn't follow it blindly, the final and fourth machine would be a walk in the park. Heh. I was stuck for another **four** hours doing initial information gathering about the two remaining machines. Why? Well, my methodology that I had build up over time said that if active discovery scripts like `wfuzz` and `gobuster` and the like don't yield any results from the first two thirds of the `directory-2.3-medium.txt` wordlist (thank you, IppSec) then it's likely not going to yield anything useful at all. That had been the case almost always in the past (I rooted ~35 machines in the lab, by the way), so it was likely not the case here either. *Trust your methodo...* you get where I'm going with this.

Eventually I got the first lead and from that point the remaining attack wasn't all that complicated. I quickly identified what I needed to identify, I *finally* had learned how to use my methodology efficiently and I immediately knew how to overcome all the hurdles that I encountered during the final compromisation. I had finally rooted 4/5 machines and finally obtained (in theory) 80 points and could finally either get some well-deserved sleep or prepare my penetration testing report. I wasn't going to get any sleep at that point that was for sure - quite honestly I was shaking all over my body and my heart was racing like mad, from pure exhilaration - so I spend a few hours on preparing my report and then went to bed when my nerves had calmed down again.

### Trust your methodology, but don't follow it blindly
If you're still with me you have my deepest thanks. To wrap all of this up I hope that I have succeeded at least a little bit in expressing my thoughts about what my methodology and also biggest take-away from the course and exam. It has taken me a while to even be able to put words to what this new-grown "feeling" of mine even is. The feeling of weighing up the different paths with one another and exploring the most likely paths little by little.

Please feel free to reach out to me on Discord at `@birb#0001` with anything you might want to share. I will happily listen to your thought and feedback or further discuss anything you've read in here today. Once again, thank you for staying with me this far. 

May the winds guide you.
